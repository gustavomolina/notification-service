## Implementation Details

### Backend

1. **Domain Models**:
   - `User`: Stores user information, subscriptions, and preferred channels
   - `Message`: Stores message information with category and content
   - `Notification`: Stores notification delivery information and status

2. **Repositories**:
   - `UserRepository`: Manages user data and queries
   - `MessageRepository`: Manages message data and queries
   - `NotificationRepository`: Manages notification data and queries

3. **Services**:
   - `NotificationService` (interface): Defines contract for notification channels
   - `EmailNotificationService`: Implements email notifications
   - `SmsNotificationService`: Implements SMS notifications
   - `PushNotificationService`: Implements push notifications
   - `NotificationStrategyService`: Selects appropriate channel based on user preferences
   - `MessageService`: Handles message creation and notification dispatch
   - `NotificationLogService`: Manages notification logs and statistics

4. **Controllers**:
   - `MessageController`: Handles message creation and retrieval
   - `NotificationLogController`: Handles notification log retrieval and statistics

5. **Database**:
   - Schema migrations with Flyway
   - Initial data seeding with sample users and messages
   - Proper indexing for performance

### Frontend

1. **Components**:
   - `MessageFormComponent`: Form for sending new messages
   - `NotificationLogComponent`: Display for notification history

2. **Services**:
   - `NotificationService`: Handles API communication

3. **Models**:
   - DTOs for API requests and responses

### Docker Configuration

1. **Docker Compose**:
   - Backend service
   - Frontend service
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Networking between services
   - Volume for database persistence

## Conclusion

All requirements from the original specification have been successfully implemented. The system is capable of receiving messages, forwarding them to users based on their subscriptions and preferred channels, and providing a user interface for sending messages and viewing notification logs.

The implementation follows best practices, SOLID principles, and design patterns as specified in the evaluation criteria. The architecture is scalable and prepared for future requirements, such as adding new notification channels or message categories.
